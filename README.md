Revolution SDK (Dec. 11, 2009)
=============

A work-in-progress decompilation of the December 11, 2009 version of the Revolution SDK.

This repository does not contain any of the original objects. An existing copy of the game [`[SC5PGN]`](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=SC5PGN) *Challenge Me: Word Puzzles* is required. (See [Building](#building) below.)

Supported versions:

- Debug
- Release

Dependencies
============

Windows
--------

On Windows, it's recommended to use native tooling. WSL or msys2 are not required.  
When running under WSL, [objdiff](#diffing) is unable to get filesystem notifications for automatic rebuilds.

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add it to `%PATH%`.
  - Also available from the [Windows Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/python-311/9NRWMJP3717K).
- Download [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and add it to `%PATH%`.
  - Quick install via pip: `pip install ninja`

macOS
------

- Install [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages):

  ```sh
  brew install ninja
  ```

- Install [wine-crossover](https://github.com/Gcenx/homebrew-wine):

  ```sh
  brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/wine-crossover
  ```

After OS upgrades, if macOS complains about `Wine Crossover.app` being unverified, you can unquarantine it using:

```sh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine '/Applications/Wine Crossover.app'
```

Linux
------

- Install [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages).
- For non-x86(\_64) platforms: Install wine from your package manager.
  - For x86(\_64), [wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo), a minimal 32-bit Windows binary wrapper, will be automatically downloaded and used.

Building
========

- Clone the repository:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/muff1n1634/sdk_2009-12-11.git
  ```

- Extract the SDK objects:
  - Replace `SC5PGN.iso` with the path to your copy of *Challenge Me*.

  ```sh
  dtk vfs cp SC5PGN.iso/build/libs/Debug/slamWiiD.a SC5PGN.iso/build/libs/Release/slamWii.a orig/
  ```

  - Only extract the archives, *not* the objects within the archives. The extraction of the objects from the archives are handled as part of the build.
  - After the initial build, the original archives can be deleted to save space.

- Configure:

  ```sh
  python configure.py
  ```

  Both debug and release objects are configured to build at the same time, so there is no need to configure this with command-line options. (Thanks [@robojumper](https://github.com/robojumper)!)

- Build:

  ```sh
  ninja
  ```

Diffing
=======

Once the initial build succeeds, an `objdiff.json` should exist in the project root.

Download the latest release from [encounter/objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff). Under project settings, set `Project directory`. The configuration should be loaded automatically.

Select an object from the left sidebar to begin diffing. Changes to the project will rebuild automatically: changes to source files, headers, or `configure.py`.
